# JungleBoys

Jungleboys is an online multiplayer 3-dimensional fighting game. Players choose from a selection of 8 characters in the pre-game lobby and then enter the jungle map. Players can collect items from chests, and increase health and stamina by picking apples from bushes. The objective is to find other player and engage in combat. When one player or team remains the game is over. Players can also be revived by teammates or a self-revive item. JungleBoys is in early development by myself using Unreal Engine 5.3.
